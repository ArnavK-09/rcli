# 🧗‍♀️ NPM Cli Written In Rust

> [!NOTE]
> This template is designed to help you create and publish npm/npx command-line interfaces (CLIs) written in Rust, leveraging the power of the ratatui library. This template packages binaries and publishes them to npm, supporting different platforms.

## ✨ Overview

This project aims to provide a robust and efficient template for building CLI tools using Rust's performance and safety guarantees. By leveraging the ratatui library, developers can create terminal user interfaces (TUIs) with ease, enabling interactive and visually appealing CLI experiences.

## 🥗 Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The template supports different platforms, ensuring your CLI can run seamlessly on various operating systems.
- **Binary Packaging**: The generated binaries are packaged and published to npm, allowing for easy distribution and installation via npm or npx.
- **Ratatui Integration**: Leverage the ratatui library to create visually appealing and interactive TUIs, enhancing the user experience of your CLI.
- **Rust Efficiency**: Benefit from Rust's performance and memory safety guarantees, ensuring your CLI runs efficiently and reliably.

## 🌻 Usage

> To demonstrate the usage of CLI, here's an example:

```bash
npx rust_cli_for_npx
```

This command will execute the CLI packaged and published to npm via this template.
